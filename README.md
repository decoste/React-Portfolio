# React-Portfolio

Hello! :raising_hand:

My name is Ala DeCoste, and I arrived in the United States in October of 2015 from Jordan.  I have a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from Al Balqa’ Applied University (my years of attendance being from 2005-2010).

Since 2017 I have been employed at Idexx Laboratories as a data analyst and am certified in Splunk Core Power user.    Additionally, I work part-time as an Arabic interpreter.
Recently, I began an intensive coding bootcamp course in order to become a full-stack developer.  This class will greatly enhance my work skills as my job requires a knowledge of coding.

I consider myself to be a motivated individual who is able to multi-task and welcome challenging projects even if I only little experience in a particular area.  Life is one long learning experience and a person is never too old to better themselves.

Upon arriving in this country, as soon as I was able to obtain a work permit, I quickly began balancing my schedule around three jobs.  At the time I did not have a car and relied upon public transportation.  My jobs consisted of working as a cashier in a department store, as well as working as a waitress in a local restaurant, and teaching math to afterschool students who were not yet proficient in the English language.
